# Point of this project #
Have you ever played, or seen someone else playing a game like Vampire Survivors and thought: 
"That'd be fun, but I wish it was free and I could play with my friends."? 

Well, look no further than this repo, I am slowly working towards making a fun and entertaining game lie Vampire Survivors you can play in your browser with your friends.
